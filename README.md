# odin-recipes

Just a tutorial to learn some basic web dev. I work mostly on mainframe, so this is all new to me. I decided to play around with Odin Project primarily because I think I'll need to know some full-stack for a couple classes I'll be taking in the OMSCS program. (Or at least they will make the process somewhat less painful.)

Anyways, this will ostensibly be a list of recipes, though to be honest, I don't do much except toss stuff into my instant pot.
